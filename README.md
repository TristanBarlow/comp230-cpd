# Weekly Reports

## Week One

After a long break, without much structure to my days, coming back to a routine I've forgotten has been challenging. In particular, I found my focus wondering during lectures. I believe this is because of the long summer where the only work I did was recreational. With the difficulty of the modules being greater than ever, I hope that I can start to focus as well, if not better than last year. To quickly get back into the routine of university life, I will make sure there are as few distractions as possible during each lecture.

## Week Two

This Week, during the second comp220 lectures we explored in more depth: OpenGL, fragment shaders, and vertex shaders. After the lecture I found myself playing around with the new concepts taught, however, I felt like I there was a gap in my knowledge. For the majority of week 2 changing and experimenting with these new concepts meant that all the extra time I put into my uni work went in that direction. As a result of this progress in other modules were slowed. In the future, I will refrain from self-teaching content, when I know that the content will be covered in future lectures. 

## Week Three

During the comp 230 lecture this week, we engaged in a class dialogue. The dialogue involved everyone in the group expressing their thoughts on the current topic. The aim of this dialogue was for everyone to benefit from hearing the opinions of others and not to challenge those opinions but to accept them and ask them to explain their viewpoints. I found myself challenging the thoughts of my peers and not asking them to explain their opinions. Next week during our next dialogue I will be more respectful and ask for my peers to explain their viewpoints.
