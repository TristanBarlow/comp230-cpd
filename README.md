# Weekly Reports

## Week One

After a long break, without much structure to my days, coming back to a routine I've forgotten has been challenging. In particular, I found my focus wondering during lectures. I believe this is because of the long summer where the only work I did was recreational. With the difficulty of the modules being greater than ever, I hope that I can start to focus as well, if not better than last year. To quickly get back into the routine of university life, I will make sure there are as few distractions as possible during each lecture.

## Week Two

This Week, during the second comp220 lectures we explored in more depth: OpenGL, fragment shaders, and vertex shaders. After the lecture I found myself playing around with the new concepts taught, however, I felt like I there was a gap in my knowledge. For the majority of week 2 changing and experimenting with these new concepts meant that all the extra time I put into my uni work went in that direction. As a result of this progress in other modules were slowed. In the future, I will refrain from self-teaching content, when I know that the content will be covered in future lectures. 

## Week Three

During the comp 230 lecture this week, we engaged in a class dialogue. The dialogue involved everyone in the group expressing their thoughts on the current topic. The aim of this dialogue was for everyone to benefit from hearing the opinions of others and not to challenge those opinions but to accept them and ask them to explain their viewpoints. I found myself challenging the thoughts of my peers and not asking them to explain their opinions. Next week during our next dialogue I will be more respectful and ask for my peers to explain their viewpoints.

## Week Four
In week four, I found large frustration with my inability to focus on one task for any meaningful amount of time. For example, on Tuesday, I sat down to improve the structure of my comp220 project. Shortly after starting I found myself getting bored of the reformatting and I begin to code some new mechanics for our group game project. I am usually very productive  productive but constantly flicking between tasks reduced the efficiency of the work period as a whole. In the future, I will sit down and force myself to work on one task at a time, in the hopes that this will improve the quality and quantity of work I produce. 

## Week Five
With the first deadline of the semester comes the time management problems that all experience. However, a more stressing problem occurred this week. The assessment for COMP210_1 had us write up an academic report for a game within the games academy, using a website as the medium to present our report. During the lecture on Tuesday, I found out that the observation work I had been conducting (an eyeball report, which I then wrote down) was not considered scientific. This happened because I rushed into the assignment without first researching the correct method to gather observation data. To make sure this does not happen again I will be sure of the scientific method before starting.  

## Week Six
Week six was meant to be reading week however, it was changed, unofficially to open studio practice week at the last minute. I was planning on using this week to complete my research journal assignment instead, my game development team required us to be in every day. The issues I had with this week is my commitment to a plan. I found myself going in and working on the game as appose to doing the research journal as I had planned. This with the deadline for the research journal fast approaching working on the game should not be the priority right now. In future, I, when I create a sensible plan sticking to it, will be more beneficial to me in the long run.

## Week Seven
The issues I had this week came in the COMP220 Lecture. I found myself losing concentration, this was because of the complex nature of the material covered. To better keep my concentration when in class I will open the lecture slides and follow through the material as we go, rather than trying to implement the material being covered. 

## Week Eight
Issue: Submitting the first and last version on the day the work is due.
Effect: Could miss submission if anything something unexpected happens. 
Solution: Always submit even a working progress one day before the deadline is due. That way worse come to worse I will have something submitted.


## 5 Key skills WORK IN PROGRESS
Sticking to a formualted plan of action.
~ I will do this by creating a plan of action for each module and assessing how closly I follow the plan.

To better control my emotitions when conversing with peers.
~ I will do this by learning three mental calming techniques and practices them when feeling adverse emotions (frustration)

Increase my proficienccy at diaglouging.
~ I will do this by engaging in at least three structured dialogues a month.

I will improve my c# skills to increase my knowledge of programming languages.
~ I will do this by creating a small 2D game with my friend(artist) hopefully to a level where I can publish it
on the appstore.

Increase my knowledge on stratagies for learning.
~ I will do this by reading a research paper and trying to implement one methods described to learn a new aspect in unreal engine. And assessing 
which one is most effective for me.
