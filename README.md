# Weekly Reports

## Week One

After a long break, without much structure to my days, coming back to a routine I've forgotten has been challenging. In particular, I found my focus wondering during lectures. I believe this is because of the long summer where the only work I did was recreational. With the difficulty of the modules being greater than ever, I hope that I can start to focus as well, if not better than last year. To quickly get back into the routine of university life, I will make sure there are as few distractions as possible during each lecture.
