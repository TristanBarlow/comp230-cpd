\section{Introduction}
When starting this course, almost two years ago now, I wanted to make games. My career goals were to become a programmer who made games. After the game making opportunities given to me, I have found that my career goals have changed. Initially, the small challenges and problems that came with creating and implementing standard game mechanics were interesting and unique. Same too for the implementation of UI components. However, these tasks have started to seem repetitive, more like a grind than an interesting problem to solve. Modules such as the MicroRTS bot have allowed me to realise the novelty and joy I can find when using my programming knowledge to solve new and engaging problems. When the opportunity arose to work on PocketPals a new app that will use GeoLocation services, I knew the challenge and uniqueness of the problem presented would prove enjoyable. I was not wrong. My career goals solely consist of finding a job that will stretch my creativity and challenge my knowledge forcing me to learn new things. Whether it's in the games industry or in IT it matters not, provided these criteria are met.

\section{Affective Domain: To stop my frustation towards poorly designed systems influence my actions.}
When trying to work in an old/bad designed system it can be frustrating might make rash decisions(mass deletes, give up)
MicroRTS while fun, was a terribly designed system hard to get a grip on, led me to leave it for the first few weeks.\\
S.    To reduce the number of sessions it takes before implementing something in an existing system \\
M.   I will measure this by the time it takes from starting on an existing project until I implement something of reasonable complexity\\
A .  Taking short breaks and focusing on specific relevant parts of the system and start by implementing something small then building.\\
R.   By reducing the number of sessions I take will mean I am overcoming my frustration and haven't resorted to abandoning or deleting parts of a project.\\
T.   By the end of the summer, I will be better at implementing and not redesigning \\

\section{Interpersonal Domain: To better communicate to colleagues what I can deliver and what I can not.}
In industry, being able to communicate what is in your scope to make given a time restraint is crucial to stop colleagues
being disappointed they perceive you as under delivering
When asked if I can do something that will challenge me or require a lot of creativity I almost always say I will try.
Often saying I can do it in the time restraint before giving it enough thought. \\
S. Increase the number of times what I deliver satisfies the user story 90 \% \\
M. I will count the number of times I fail and succeed to deliver a mutually agreed milestone\\
A. I will draw rough Gantt charts of the workflow to communicate what can be done hopefully to create more realistic milestones \\
R. Being able to increase the satisfaction rate proves I can communicate what my colleague can expect to receive.\\
T. Over the summer I will be working on a milestone basis with PocketPals By the end, I will hopefully have a 90\%  delivery ratio.\\

\section{Dispositional Domain: To effectively evaluate when investing more time into to a problem is not worth the impact the solved problem will have.}
Relevant: Working on High effort low impact items, is good to burn out without contributing much\\
Example: Hours tweaking AI variables - hardly any difference - wasted many hours\\

\section{Cognitive Domain: To learn how C++ and C\#  can be used to write multiplatform plugins}
Relevant: C\# Is used in Unity and C++ in unreal, The two biggest game engines. Being able to write joint platform plugins will be very employable\\
Example: Dissertation project for next year might need it, I have no idea how it works  \\
S.To build 3 simple algorithms that can run in a C++ and a C\# envirnoment\\
